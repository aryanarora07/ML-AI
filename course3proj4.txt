# Report: Developing and Maintaining an LLM Application with Prompt Flow  

## Task Definition  
**Use Case**: Customer Support Chatbot  
**Objective**: Develop a chatbot to handle user queries, provide accurate responses, and escalate issues when necessary. The application aims to improve customer service efficiency and reduce response times.  

---

## Prompt Flow Design  
The chatbot’s prompt flow was designed using Azure’s visual editor, with the following components:  
1. **Input Nodes**: Capture user queries (e.g., “How do I reset my password?”).  
2. **Model Nodes**: Process inputs using an LLM (e.g., GPT-4) to generate responses or categorize queries for escalation.  
3. **Output Nodes**: Deliver structured responses to users or route queries to the appropriate department.  
4. **External APIs**: Integrated with Serp API for additional data retrieval and Azure’s authentication services for password resets.  

**Flow Diagram**:  
```  
User Query → Input Node → Model Node (LLM) → Output Node (Response or Escalation)  
```

## Prototype Summary  
**Steps**:  
1. **Implementation**: The flow was built using Azure’s prompt flow tools, including the visual editor and Python tools for custom logic.  
2. **Testing**: Tested with sample queries to identify inconsistencies in responses.  
3. **Optimization**: Experimented with different prompt variants to improve response accuracy.  

**Challenges**:  
- Ensuring prompt clarity for diverse queries.  
- Integrating external APIs for real-time data retrieval.  

**Solutions**:  
- Used Azure’s debugging tools to trace interactions and refine prompts.  
- Leveraged Python tools to handle API integrations and data preprocessing.

## Monitoring Insights  
**Metrics Tracked**:  
1. **Latency**: Average response time was reduced to under 2 seconds.  
2. **Error Rates**: Errors decreased by 15% after prompt optimization.  
3. **Usage Patterns**: Identified peak query times for resource scaling.  

**Feedback Analysis**: User feedback highlighted the need for clearer escalation instructions, which were incorporated into the flow.  

**Tools Used**: Azure’s monitoring tools provided real-time insights, enabling continuous improvement.

## Future Improvements  
1. **Scalability**: Implement load balancing to handle higher query volumes during peak times.  
2. **Personalization**: Use user data to provide tailored responses.  
3. **Automation**: Integrate CI/CD pipelines for seamless flow updates and version control.
