Part 2: Debugging Prompt Failures

1. Problematic Prompt
Prompt: "Explain quantum physics and include jokes."

Response:
Quantum physics is about tiny particles like electrons and photons behaving weirdly. They can be in two places at once—wild, right? Here’s a joke: Why don’t quantum physicists date? Because they’re always in superposition—here and not here! Anyway, particles also have wave-like properties, and measuring them changes stuff. Pretty cool, huh? Oh, and here’s another joke: What’s a quantum physicist’s favorite dance? The wave-particle shuffle!

Analysis:

What went wrong?

Vagueness: The prompt doesn’t specify what aspect of quantum physics to explain (e.g., principles, applications, history), so the response is overly broad and shallow.
Lack of Structure: It’s unclear how the jokes should integrate—randomly sprinkled or tied to concepts—so they feel disjointed.
Complexity Overload: Quantum physics is intricate, but the prompt doesn’t guide the depth, leading to a simplistic explanation.
Tone Ambiguity: Is it supposed to be serious with humor or fully lighthearted? The response wavers.
2. Debugging the Prompt
To fix this, I’ll:

Break it into clear steps (explain specific concepts, then add humor).
Add context (e.g., target audience, depth of explanation).
Clarify the role of jokes (e.g., to illustrate concepts).
Refined Prompt: "You are a science educator explaining quantum physics to high school students. Write a 150-word explanation of two key concepts—superposition and wave-particle duality—in simple terms. After each concept, include a short, relevant joke to make it engaging and memorable."

3. Test the Refined Prompt
Response:

Quantum physics studies tiny particles and their strange behaviors. First, superposition means particles like electrons can exist in multiple states—like being in two places—at once, until measured. Imagine a coin spinning in the air: it’s heads and tails until it lands. Joke: Why did the electron refuse to choose? It didn’t want to collapse its options!

Second, wave-particle duality says particles act like both waves and solid bits. Light can spread like a ripple or hit like a bullet, depending on how you test it. It’s like nature’s magic trick! Joke: Why was the photon a bad comedian? Its punchlines kept waving goodbye!

These ideas show how the quantum world defies everyday rules—pretty mind-blowing, right?

Word Count: ~150

Analysis:

Improvement: The response focuses on two concepts, explains them simply, and ties jokes to each idea, making it engaging and structured.
Differences: Unlike the vague version, this is concise, audience-appropriate (high school level), and the humor enhances rather than distracts.


PART 3:

Part 3: Evaluating Prompt Effectiveness
Task: Use evaluation metrics to assess the quality of AI responses and refine prompts based on feedback.
For this part, I’ll create a prompt, generate a response, evaluate it using the given metrics, refine the prompt, and compare the results.
